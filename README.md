# mern_HeroDB - MERN Fullstack testing app

Created a MERN Fullstack app using React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

Before we begin, you will need to have the following installed: Node.js. (Created this app by following a tutorial from Academind in the Udemy course: React, NodeJS, Express & MongoDB - The MERN Fullstack Guide)

This is an on-going project and will contnue to grow as additional features will be added gradually. Main purpose of this app is to be a test app to use for automation testing frameworks.


### Installing Node.js

Go to http://nodejs.org, and click the Install button. Run the installer that you just downloaded.
When the installer completes, a message indicates that Node was installed at /usr/local/bin/node and npm was installed at /usr/local/bin/npm.
At this point node.js is ready to use.


### Setting up MongoDB Atlas

To set up Mongodb Atlas, refer to https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/getting-started/


### Starting the app

Pull or download the files.

Open a terminal window, cd to the mern_HeroDB/backend directory, and execute the following command to install the express module: npm install

Open a terminal window, cd to the mern_HeroDB/frontend directory, and execute the following command to install the express module: npm install

A node_modules folder is created in the mern_HeroDB folder, and the Express, and MongoDB modules are installed in a subfolder of node_modules.

Run npm start in backend and frontend directories.


You can start entering data into the HeroDB on the front-end side. To get started, go to: http://localhost:3000 and enter away values to test it out.
